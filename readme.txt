This readme file contains the steps to create and configure the S3 bucket and EC2 instance used in this assignment in Part1 and Part2 respectively.
The URLs for the Part-1 and Part-2 are at the end of the page. I also added a separate text file containing only the links for the assignments. 


Steps to create and configure S3 bucket-

Step 1: Create a bucket- Sign in to the AWS Management Console and choose Create bucket then enter the Bucket name
Step 2: Enable static website hosting- Under Static website hosting, choose Enable.
Step 3: Edit Block Public Access settings- Under Block public access (bucket settings), choose Edit. Clear Block all public access, and choose Save changes.
Step 4: Add a bucket policy that makes your bucket content publicly available- To grant public read access for your website, update the bucket policy.
Step 5: Configure an index document
Step 6: Configure an error document
Step 7: Test your website endpoint
Step 8: Clean up


Steps to create and configure EC2 instance-

Step 1: Log in to AWS Console- Go to the AWS Management Console. Log in with your AWS credentials.
Step 2: Navigate to EC2 Dashboard- In the Services menu at the top, search for and select EC2.
Step 3: Launch a New Instance- In the EC2 Dashboard, click the Launch Instance button. Give your instance a name.
Step 4: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)- You will be prompted to choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Select Ubuntu Server. Ensure that the AMI is free-tier eligible.
Step 5: Select an Instance Type- Choose an Instance Type. For the free tier, select t2.micro, which includes 1 vCPU and 1 GB RAM.
Step 6: Configure Instance Details- Keep the default settings for most configurations. Ensure Auto-assign Public IP is enabled so the instance is publicly accessible. In the Network section, make sure you're using the default VPC.
Step 7: Configure Security Group- A security group acts as a virtual firewall. Youâ€™ll need to set inbound rules for your instance to allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80/443) traffic.
Step 8: Review and Launch- Review all the settings for your instance.
Step 9. Create/Select Key Pair
You will be prompted to choose an existing key pair or create a new key pair.If creating a new key pair: Download the key pair (.pem file) and store it securely. You will need this to connect to your instance via SSH.
Step 10: Connect to Your EC2 Instance
After your instance launches, click View Instances to go to the EC2 Dashboard.
Connect to the instance via SSH using the .pem file:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i "path/to/your-key.pem" ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
Replace "path/to/your-key.pem" with the location of your .pem file and your-ec2-public-ip with your instance's public IP address.
Step 11: Install and Configure Web Server- After connecting to your instance, you can set up a web server. For example, to install Apache:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
Start the Apache service:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
Now, your instance is running a web server. You can visit the public IP of your EC2 instance in a browser, and it will serve the Apache default page.
